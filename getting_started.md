## Setting up the environment

First we need to setup a conda environement with the following

    conda create --name cutqc python=3.12
    conda activate cutqc 
    conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/gurobi
    conda install gurobi
    pip install numpy qiskit matplotlib pydot scipy tqdm pylatexenc scikit-learn    
tensorflow networkx torch qiskit-aer psutil
        
## Running with slurm

When initializing distributed, the worker nodes must have a way to initialize communication with the host node. The following must be set in the slurm file for running the distributed reconstruction to ensure this can happen. 

    # Setup for Multi-node Workload
    export MASTER_PORT=$(get_free_port)  # Get a free Port
    export WORLD_SIZE=$(($SLURM_NNODES * $SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE))
    master_addr=$(scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST" | head -n 1) 
    export MASTER_ADDR=$master_addr

    # Sanity Print
    echo "MASTER_ADDR="$MASTER_ADDR
    echo "MASTER_PORT="$MASTER_PORT
    echo "WORLD_SIZE="$WORLD_SIZE


## Cutting and Evaluation 

Before reconstruction can be performed, any given circuit must first be cut and evaluated, and the results saved to a `.pkl` file. This can be done using `cutqc.save_cutqc_obj(filename)` as seen in the `cut_and_eval.py` file.

Run `cut_and_eval.py` using the corresponding Slurm script. In other words:

    sbatch cut_and_eval.slurm

Running the slurm script should produce an output file containing:

    --- Cut --- 
    Set parameter GURO_PAR_SPECIAL
    Set parameter TokenServer to value "license.rc.princeton.edu"
    --- Evaluate ---
    --- Dumping CutQC Object into adder_example.pkl ---
    Completed

## Reconstruction

Once the circuit is cut and the results are computed, you can run parallel reconstruction by calling the slurm script:

    sbatch dist_driver.slurm

Running the slurm script should produce an output file containing:

      MASTER_ADDR=adroit-h11g3
      MASTER_PORT=31179
      WORLD_SIZE=2
